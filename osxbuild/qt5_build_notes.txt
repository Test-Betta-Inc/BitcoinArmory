There are some files in this directory relating to building Qt 5 for the Mac.
There is build-qt5.sh, which is the script you run to download the Qt 5 source
and build it. Currently it has been tested with building from a Linux machine.
There is also qt5-qmake.conf, which is used by the build-qt5.sh script.

Building natively on the Mac probably doesn't work right now. The next step is
to make sure the native Mac builds also work.

(1) Install the Mac SDK. The Mac SDK is included with Xcode. The build-qt5.sh
    script has been tested with (and currently expects) the 10.9 SDK. On Linux,
    the SDK's contents should be placed in /usr/share/Mac10.9.sdk/.

(2) Install cctools-port if building on Linux. I had to use the first link on
    Debian Jessie, but the second link is the version used by BC Core.

(3) Run ./build-qt5.sh in a terminal (command line).

(4) You should find the result of the Qt 5 build in install-qt5.

Notes:

* We use Qt 5.2.1 like BC Core uses, because newer versions of Qt 5 require
  Xcode to build for OS X. See https://bugreports.qt.io/browse/QTBUG-41908 for
  more information. Requiring Xcode is a problem for cross-builds.

* Building Qt 4 with a similar script was attempted, but it seems like Qt 5 was
  better designed with cross-compilation in mind than Qt 4 was. It seems like
  it isn't worth it to try getting Qt 4 cross-compiling for OS X builds.
